1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React JS is JS library and one of many problems it solves is the problem when it comes to updating the DOM. Instead of updating the entire DOM which affects how fast the UI changes. React will only update the parts of the UI that has changed. React is based on scalable, reusable components.
